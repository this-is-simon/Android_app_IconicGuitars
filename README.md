An Android app about the most iconic guitars on the last 80 years

This is an app I created using Java and Android Studio to curate some of the most iconic guitars over the past 80 years, add them to a Favourites list, and enter your monthly 'guitar fund' budget to see how long it would take you to afford one of these original guitars. I have included .png screen shot files called IconicGuitars so you can get an idea of what the app does at a glance.

The app uses SharedPreferences in order to persist all data stored within the app, so that the budget you enter and the guitars you add to your favourites list will not be lost once you shut down the app. The app also makes use of Google's Material Design principles to make the UI look clean and easy to use.

This app was a week-long project I completed as part of the Codeclan 16-week intensive Software Development course in Edinburgh, having studied Java for only 2 weeks and Android for an additional week.

Enjoy!
